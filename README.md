Differential expression analysis between ER and TCGA cohorts was conducted using DESeq2 implemented via rpy2. The analysis utilized the raw count matrix with corresponding sample metadata. The DESeq2 workflow included normalization, dispersion estimation, and negative binomial generalized linear model fitting. Significance thresholds were set at absolute log2 fold change > 2 and adjusted p-value < 0.001. Results were visualized through a volcano plot with capped fold changes and a combined violin-boxplot showing expression patterns of top differentially expressed genes.

For machine learning analysis, five classifiers were implemented and evaluated: logistic regression, random forest, AdaBoost, gradient boosting, and a self-supervised neural network. The models were trained on TPM values using a 70% test split. The self-supervised architecture included an encoder network with three hidden layers (512, 256, 128 units) and ReLU activations. Model performance was assessed through standard classification metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best performing model was subsequently applied to predict class labels across the full TCGA dataset.
